    "- Show your work. Give reasoning. The question isn't always going to ask for it, because we assume that you will provide justification for your answers. **If you don't supply reasoning, you won't get full credit.**\n",
    "- Every answer should contain a calculation, reasoning, or diagrams that are clearly labeled to show what's going on. For example, a calculation such as $(1/3)0.8 + (2/3)0.7$ or ```sum([(1/3)*0.8, (2/3)*0.7])``` is fine without further explanation or simplification. If we want you to simplify, we'll ask you to. But just $\\binom{5}{2}$ by itself is not fine; write \"we want any 2 out of the 5 frogs and they can appear in any order\" or whatever reasoning you used. Reasoning can be brief and abbreviated, e.g. \"product rule\" or \"not mutually exclusive.\"\n",
    "- You may consult others (see \"How to Do Your Homework\" above) but you must write up your own answers using your own words, notation, and sequence of steps.\n",
